    <h2>Fourier transform이란?</h2>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform" target="_blank" title="wiki"><strong>Fourier transform
                (FT)</strong></a> decomposes a function (often a function of the time, or a signal) into
        its
        constituent
        frequencies. A special case is the expression of a musical chord in terms of the volumes and frequencies of its
        constituent notes.The term Fourier transform refers to both the frequency domain representation and the
        mathematical operation that associates the frequency domain representation to a function of time. The Fourier
        transform of a function of time is itself a complex-valued function of frequency, whose magnitude (modulus)
        represents the amount of that frequency present in the original function, and whose argument is the phase offset
        of
        the basic sinusoid in that frequency. The Fourier transform is not limited to functions of time, but the domain
        of
        the original function is commonly referred to as the time domain. There is also an inverse Fourier transform
        that
        mathematically synthesizes the original function from its frequency domain representation.

    <p>Linear operations performed in one domain (time or frequency) have corresponding operations in the other domain,
        which are sometimes easier to perform. The operation of differentiation in the time domain corresponds to
        multiplication by the frequency,[remark 1] so some differential equations are easier to analyze in the frequency
        domain. Also, convolution in the time domain corresponds to ordinary multiplication in the frequency domain (see
        Convolution theorem). After performing the desired operations, transformation of the result can be made back to
        the
        time domain. Harmonic analysis is the systematic study of the relationship between the frequency and time
        domains,
        including the kinds of functions or operations that are "simpler" in one or the other, and has deep connections
        to
        many areas of modern mathematics.
